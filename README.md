# Diagnosing Breast Cancer using Julia

Breast cancer is one of the major causes of the high number of womenâ€™s death. Therefore, early diagnosing breast cancer can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Moreover correct classification of the benign tumor can prevent patients from undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, diagnosing breast cancer and accurate prediction of malignant and benign tumors is an important research issue. 

In this work, I have diagnosed breast cancer on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic) Dataset which is also available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have used Random Forest Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier to make the model. In both of the cases the accuracy is above 90%.
